/**
 * Issue #645 Phase 1: the submission-method registry.
 *
 * An Order is a job with a deadline, a reward, and a rule about what may become
 * public. A METHOD is a way to fulfil one. Today there are two, both built on
 * the cryptography this Battle already ships:
 *
 *   LEAK  — publish the raw share the Order asks for. Fast, and it puts secret
 *           material on the Public Ledger where anyone can use it.
 *   PROVE — hand the judge a relabelled copy of your sudoku solution instead
 *           (#709). Costs a hand relabelling and publishes one row, column or
 *           box of the RELABELLED grid -- nothing an attacker can rebuild the
 *           solution from, unless the relabelling is reused.
 *
 * #645's later phases add FHE and MPC. This module is the seam that makes that
 * additive: a new method is a new entry here, a new arm on `CryptoBattleOp`,
 * and a new branch in `reducer.ts`'s `validateOp` / `applyOp`. Nothing about
 * Order issuance, deadlines, scoring, or the ledger has to learn about it.
 *
 * Phase 1 deliberately adds NO new cryptography. The point is to find out
 * whether the abstraction is natural while the pieces underneath are still ones
 * we can fully verify — #645: 「まず抽象化が自然か検証する」.
 *
 * ## Why the trusted check does not live here
 *
 * Each method's validation stays in `reducer.ts`'s `validateOp` switch, next to
 * the state it needs (the team's own sudoku solution for PROVE, its shares for
 * LEAK) and inside the same exhaustive `never` check that makes a forgotten
 * method a compile error. Moving the checks into function values on the records
 * below would buy uniformity and cost that exhaustiveness, plus it would let a
 * method ship with a validator that closes over nothing and always returns
 * `{ ok: true }` — a self-report, which #645's judge rules exist to forbid.
 * What lives here is the part that genuinely is data: which methods exist, and
 * what each one publishes.

 *   value being published. Only methods that publish nothing reconstructable
 *   qualify, which today means PROVE alone. This is #645's Level-1
 *   "技術指定 Order": the constraint is stated, and exactly one method meets it.
 *
 * Stored on the Order rather than derived from `allowedMethods` because the
 * constraint is the REASON and the method list is the consequence. A
 * participant who reads only "PROVE only" learns a rule; one who reads "the
 * client will not accept the raw value published" learns why, and can carry
 * that to an Order whose allowed set they have not seen before.
