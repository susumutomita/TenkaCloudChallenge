/**
 * Issue #645 Phase 2: the additively homomorphic cipher behind FHE Orders.
 *
 * An FHE Order hands a team two ciphertexts and asks for the encryption of
 * their sum, without ever handing over the plaintexts or the key. This module
 * is the scheme that makes that a real cryptographic exercise rather than a
 * story about one.
 *
 * ## The scheme
 *
 * Over the same prime field `field.ts` already uses, with a secret key `k_i`
 * per input:
 *
 * ```text
 * Enc_i(m; r) = (r, m + k_i*r mod p)      r != 0, drawn per ciphertext
 * Dec_i(r, y) = y - k_i*r mod p
 * ```
 *
 * Adding two ciphertexts componentwise gives an encryption of the sum, under
 * the two inputs' combined mask:
 *
 * ```text
 * (r1, y1) + (r2, y2) = (r1+r2, y1+y2)
 * y1+y2 - (k1*r1 + k2*r2) = (m1 + k1*r1) + (m2 + k2*r2) - k1*r1 - k2*r2 = m1+m2
 * ```
 *
 * The judge holds that combined mask (it derives it from the Order), so it can
 * decrypt the sum and compare — see {@link decryptOrderSum}.
 *
 * That is the whole participant-facing operation: add two pairs of numbers and
 * take the remainder. No library, no lattice, no noise budget -- and it is not
 * a toy in the pejorative sense. It is genuinely additively homomorphic and
 * genuinely hides its plaintext, which are exactly the two properties an FHE
 * Order needs to teach.
 *
 * ## Why this scheme and not a "real" FHE library
 *
 * #645's non-goals say so directly: 「実用 FHE / MPC ライブラリの性能 benchmark を
 * 競うこと」 is out of scope. What is in scope is that a participant computes on
 * data they cannot read, and that the judge -- not the participant -- decides
 * whether the answer is right. A BFV/CKKS dependency would add megabytes, a
 * noise-growth failure mode with nothing to teach at this level, and numbers no
 * participant could check by hand. This scheme keeps every one of #645's FHE
 * acceptance criteria and stays inside §12b's arithmetic (add, multiply,
 * remainder).
 *
 * What it is NOT is fully homomorphic: there is no multiplication of two
 * ciphertexts here, only addition and multiplication by a public constant. The
 * participant-facing copy says "encrypted addition", never "FHE can do
 * anything" -- claiming otherwise would be teaching something false.
 *
 * ## What it hides, precisely
 *
 * Given `(r, y)` with `r != 0` and no knowledge of `k`, every candidate
 * plaintext `m'` is consistent: take `k' = (y - m') * r^-1 mod p`, which exists
 * because `p` is prime and `r != 0`. One ciphertext therefore carries *no*
 * information about its plaintext -- information-theoretic, not a hardness
 * assumption, and `fhe.test.ts` executes it rather than asserting it.
 *
 * **Each input gets its OWN key, and that is load-bearing.** An earlier version
 * of this module used one key for both of an Order's inputs and claimed the
 * pair was still perfectly hiding, reasoning "two equations, three unknowns".
 * That was wrong. With a shared `k`, anyone holding the published pair can
 * compute
 *
 * ```text
 * r2*y1 - r1*y2 = r2*m1 - r1*m2   (mod p)
 * ```
 *
 * -- the `k` terms cancel -- which pins `(m1, m2)` to a line: `p` possible
 * pairs out of `p^2`, not all of them. The leak was of a linear relation rather
 * than of either value, and it did not make the Order forgeable, but it is
 * exactly the kind of "looks hidden, is not" that this problem exists to teach
 * people to notice, so the scheme does not ship with it.
 *
 * With independent `k1`, `k2` the same computation gives
 * `r2*y1 - r1*y2 = r2*m1 - r1*m2 + r1*r2*(k1 - k2)`, and `k1 - k2` is an
 * unknown uniform value, so nothing is pinned: for ANY `(m1, m2)` there is a
 * key pair producing the published ciphertexts. `fhe.test.ts` executes that
 * JOINT statement, not only the single-ciphertext one -- the weaker test is
 * what let the original claim stand.
 *
 * Keys are also bound to the Order (see {@link deriveFheInputKeys}), so nothing
 * a participant later learns about one Order can unlock another.
 *
 * ## Why the participant cannot fake an answer
 *
 * The judge decrypts the submitted ciphertext and compares against the hidden
 * expected sum (#645: 「judge が decrypt + expected value compare で採点する」).
 * A participant who KNEW the expected sum could submit a ciphertext for it
 * directly -- and cannot, because the plaintexts are full field elements
 * derived from the match seed, so the sum is one value out of ~2^61. Producing
 * the right value any other way needs the keys, which the paragraph above says
 * they cannot learn. So the only tractable route to a passing submission is to
 * actually perform the homomorphic addition.
