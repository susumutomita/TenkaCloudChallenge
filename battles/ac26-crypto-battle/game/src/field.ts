/**
 * BigInt arithmetic over F_p (prime field).

 * trusted-side pure reducer (see reducer.ts header) and cryptographic
 * correctness must never depend on wall-clock or platform randomness.
 *
 * Default prime: P = 2^61 - 1, a Mersenne prime. Large enough that brute-force
 * guessing a secret is infeasible for the playtest match length, small enough
 * that every value fits in a single 64-bit-ish BigInt limb (no performance
 * cost from arbitrary-precision arithmetic in a hot reducer path).

/**
 * [Issue #696] The field an actual MATCH runs in: the prime 251.
 *
 * Not a security parameter -- a legibility one. Every Order in this Battle is
 * arithmetic the participant performs themselves, and at 2^61 - 1 that meant
 * adding nineteen-digit numbers under a five-minute deadline. The live
 * two-team run measured what that produces: a correct method, a carry slip in
 * the fourteenth digit, and a REJECTED banner that taught nothing. Homomorphic
 * addition, masked subtotals and Lagrange interpolation are structurally
 * identical at any modulus, so the modulus should be the size a person can
 * actually work in. At 251 the largest quantity anyone divides is five digits.
 *
 * Shrinking the field costs the secret its unguessability, so it is sound ONLY
 * alongside `CryptoBattleConfig.maxHuntAttemptsPerTarget`: three tries against
 * a 251-element space, at `scores.wrongHunt` apiece, keeps interpolating the
 * shares strictly cheaper than guessing. Changing one of the two without the
 * other reopens the hole -- see that field's doc comment.
 *
 * `P` above stays the module default because `field.ts` is a general F_p
 * library and its own tests exercise a large modulus; nothing in a match
 * reaches these functions without an explicit `p` from `config.prime`.
