/**
 * #659 / #661: time-based cipher ladder, with public methods and private keys.
 * Build uses Caesar; pressure and endgame use a three-shift Vigenère cycle.
 * Vigenère Orders deliberately expose one public key position at a time.
 * Three different positions disclose the cycle; repeated copies of one do not.
 * A full known plaintext/ciphertext pair covering a cycle WOULD reveal all keys.
 * These classical ciphers provide no modern chosen-plaintext security.
 *
 * Browser-safe: only arithmetic, input shape and public material coverage live
 * here. Seed-derived keys and plaintexts remain server-side in fixtures.ts.
 * RSA, rotor and a new homomorphic ladder rung are not implemented by this slice.
