 * [Issue #659] A team's key for one rung, at one generation.

 * threshold, and anything reachable from there ends up in the SPA bundle.
 * `prng.ts` imports `node:crypto`, which a browser build cannot resolve — so

 * public commitment are: ROTATE has to defend the rung it is most needed on. A
 * key derived without the generation would stay broken for the rest of the
 * match, and #659 §10's 「ROTATE だけが打ち消せる」 would quietly not be true of
 * the ladder. Deriving it here means `applyRotate` covers the ladder with no
 * branch of its own — the key it hands out after a rotate is simply a different
 * one, and every pair published under the old generation stops meaning anything.
 *
 * Zero is a legal key. It is a weak one — the ciphertext equals the plaintext —
 * and a team that draws it and leaks a pair has published its key in the
 * clearest possible way. That is the rung's lesson, not a bug to design around.
