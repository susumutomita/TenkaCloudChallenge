/**
 * [Issue #709] The 4x4 sudoku PROVE is built on.
 *
 * ## What this replaces, and why
 *
 * PROVE used to be a Schnorr proof: exponentiate, read a challenge, respond.
 * At p = 227 it was small enough to do on paper and, on the live run, still
 * read as 「べき乗して剰余」 -- an operation performed, not an idea understood.
 * The lecture's ZK sudoku is the same claim ("I hold a solution, and I will not
 * show it to you") with the mechanism VISIBLE: relabel the numbers, hand over
 * the relabelled grid, let the judge open one row. Anyone can see that a row of
 * 1..4 in some order says nothing about which digit went where in the original.
 *
 * ## The scheme, as the game runs it
 *
 *   - Each team holds a SOLUTION `S` (one of the 288 4x4 sudoku solutions),
 *     shown in MY VAULT. Eight of its cells are published as that team's
 *     PUZZLE `P` (`CryptoBattleState.publicPuzzles`).
 *   - PROVE: the team picks a relabelling π of the digits 1..4 (a permutation)
 *     and submits `π(S)` -- every cell replaced by its relabelled digit. The
 *     work is 「4 文字の置換表を作って 16 マスに当てる」, and it is done by hand.
 *   - The judge (`reducer.ts`) holds `S`, so it checks the submission is
 *     `π(S)` for SOME bijection π, then publishes one of the twelve constraint
 *     groups -- a row, a column or a box -- of the submitted grid. Soundness
 *     is total, not probabilistic: the judge sees the whole grid. Zero
 *     knowledge holds against the OTHER teams, who see four digits in some
 *     order and a tag saying which relabelling produced them.
 *   - Reusing π is the mistake this Order exists to let a team make. Two
 *     reveals under one π carry the same tag (`fixtures.ts`'s
 *     `derivePermutationTag`), and once enough cells of one `π(S)` are public,
 *     lining them up against `P` recovers π and then `S`. That is `hunt-sudoku`
 *     -- the successor of the nonce-reuse HUNT, teaching the same 「乱数を使い
 *     回すな」 with a relabelling instead of an exponent.
 *
 * ## Browser-safe on purpose
 *
 * The Portal renders grids and permutation tables from this module, so nothing
 * here may reach Node-only code. Everything derived from the match seed (which
 * solution a team gets, which cells are given, which group the judge opens, the
 * tag on a reveal) lives in `fixtures.ts` beside the rest of the seed-derived
 * material, because `prng.ts` imports `node:crypto`.
