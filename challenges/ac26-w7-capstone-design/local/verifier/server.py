"""POST /verify — the scoring seam. Loopback only, stdlib only.

Security contract (docs/curricula/advanced-cryptography-2026/TEMPLATE.md §/verify):
  - `checkpointId` is required and is echoed back verbatim. The platform fails closed on a
    missing or mismatched echo, so it can never credit another checkpoint.
  - Submissions are copied into a fresh temporary workspace. The source tree is never
    written to.
  - Learner code runs in a subprocess with a wall-clock timeout, a memory cap, and a capped
    output size. A hang, a fork bomb, or a gigabyte of prints fails the checkpoint instead
    of the verifier.
  - No learner input is ever concatenated into a shell command; the subprocess is invoked
    with an argument list and `shell=False`.
  - Responses carry `correct` and nothing else. Never the hidden test names, the expected
    values, or reference output.
  - Malformed input produces a failed checkpoint, never a crashed process.
