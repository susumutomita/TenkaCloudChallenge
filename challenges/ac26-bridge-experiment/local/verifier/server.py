"""POST /verify -- the scoring seam. Compose-internal only, stdlib only.

Security contract (docs/curricula/advanced-cryptography-2026/TEMPLATE.md §/verify):
  - `checkpointId` is required and is echoed back verbatim. The platform fails closed
    on a missing or mismatched echo, so it can never credit another checkpoint.
  - Submissions are copied into a fresh temporary workspace. The source tree is never
    written to.
  - Learner code runs in a subprocess with a wall-clock timeout, a memory cap, and a
    capped output size. A hang, a fork bomb, or a gigabyte of prints fails the
    checkpoint instead of the verifier.
  - No learner input is ever concatenated into a shell command; the subprocess is
    invoked with an argument list and `shell=False`.
  - Responses carry `correct` and, at most, a property name. Never the hidden test
    names, the expected values, or reference output.
  - Malformed input produces a failed checkpoint, never a crashed process.

Issue 543/537: this used to be the same process that also served the Participant
Portal's config, inspect, starter, public-test, and prepare endpoints, in the single
Docker stage a learner's own `make build` produced -- so `first-broken`'s expected
value (then the third element `fixtures.generate.corrupted_trace` returned) was
importable from inside the learner's own container. Moving only that checkpoint's
derivation into `verifier/expected.py` was not enough on its own: `corrupted_trace`
itself is a plain, seed-keyed function, and `fixtures/` still shipped to the
participant stage for `show.py` and the public tests, so a learner with nothing but
their own container's `FLAG_SEED` could still call it directly and read the broken
index off the two remaining pieces by hand -- no different in substance from the
leak this file exists to close.

So `fixtures/` does not ship in the participant Docker stage at all any more (see
../Dockerfile). This process is the only one that still imports it: the Portal-facing
surface lives in `participant/server.py`, in a separate image that never builds this
file, `verifier/expected.py`, or `fixtures/`, and fetches the public evidence this
file serves at `GET /public` over the Compose-internal network instead (see
../docker-compose.yml) -- never from the participant container's filesystem.
